/-! # Meta-theory of flag algebras (`MetaTheory/paper.tex`)

Formalisation of the proved results in §1–5 of `MetaTheory/paper.tex`: when forbidden-subgraph
("quotient") reasoning is *complete* for a constrained graph class.

Aggregator. Currently wires in:

* `MeasureSupport`  — §2 `lem:support-as` (almost-sure non-negativity ↔ non-negativity on the
  support of a measure).
* `EvalAlgebra`     — flag-algebra evaluations as a Stone–Weierstrass-dense subalgebra of
  `C(X_σ)` (used by §4 and, later, §5).
* `ConstrainedClass`— §3: the forbidden ideal, the quotient algebra `A^σ[T₁]`, and the
  supported space `Q_σ` with its intrinsic description `mem_Qσ_iff` and closedness.
* `SupportClosure`  — §2 `lem:support-passes-general` and §4 `def:root-planting` +
  `thm:support-criterion` (the support-closure criterion).

Still to come (§5): `Blowup` (independent blow-up, planted-mass and planted-estimate) and
`CloneClosed` (clone-closed classes are root-plantable; clique-free and triangle-free
corollary), plus
the §3 faithfulness lemma `forbiddenIdeal_eq_span` (heredity ⟹ the forbidden flags span an
ideal).
